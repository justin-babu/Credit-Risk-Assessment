# Credit-Risk-Assessment
Project: Credit Quality Assessment using Machine Learning Models

1. Developed and evaluated multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machine) to predict customer creditworthiness, achieving up to 77% accuracy and a True Positive Rate of 85% for fraud detection on an imbalanced dataset.
2. Addressed data imbalance using the SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), improving minority class detection with a Logistic Regression F1-Score of 0.56 for 'Bad' credit and ensuring more balanced model performance across different metrics.
3 .Optimized model performance through dimensionality reduction with PCA (retaining 95% variance with 42 components), threshold tuning, and hyperparameter optimization, resulting in a Balanced Bagging Classifier OOB score of 73% and an SVM accuracy of 77%.
